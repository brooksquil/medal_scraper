I was always fascinated by the 1980 winter Olympics in Lake Placid New York, maybe because they were too early for me to recall. I grew up figure skating and I know that tht year we should have taken the gold in pairs figure skating if Randi gardner had not been injured. 

I decided to present the medal standings from those olympics by scraping the dta from wikipedia. I have never scraped data before but it seemed like a fun challenge and learning experience.

I leveraged the gem 'kimurai' for scraping and scaffolded a table, model, controller, and views for a medals table. I created a spider file for the crawling and parsing of the data.

I can only successfully get the first result row but still enjoyed the experience and given more time I'm sure I could troubleshoot this.

Looking forward to any feedback
